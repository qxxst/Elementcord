# Elementcord
A theme to make Discord look like another popular messenger.
## Installation
1. Install BetterDiscord or any Discord client mod that supports CSS themes.
2. Download the latest version of the theme from the [releases](https://github.com/qxxst/Elementcord/releases) page.
3. Move the downloaded file to your `themes` folder.
4. Make sure the theme is enabled in your mod settings.
## Limitations
As a theme, there are inherently some parts of Discord that Elementcord cannot (or shouldn't) change by itself. In many of these cases, the experience can be further improved by using other themes and plugins in combination with Elementcord.

Due to the way Discord's elements are classified, some unwanted elements cannot be removed without automatically removing other, wanted elements as well. My goal is for the theme to match Element's design as closely as possible without removing necessary functionality.
