# Elementcord
Theme to make Discord look like another popular messenger.
## Installation
### Desktop
1. Install BetterDiscord or any Discord client mod that supports CSS themes.
2. Download the latest version of the theme from the [releases](https://github.com/qxxst/Elementcord/releases) page.
3. Move the downloaded file to your `themes` folder.
4. Make sure the theme is enabled in your mod settings and that your normal Discord theme is set to Dark.
### Browser
Themes can be applied in the browser using [Stylebot](https://stylebot.dev/) or any extension that supports custom CSS declarations.
## Limitations
As a theme, there are inherently some parts of Discord that Elementcord cannot (or shouldn't) change by itself. In many of these cases, the experience can be further improved by using other themes and plugins in combination with Elementcord.
